# All classes must have atleast the following fields:
# id: unique integer id for the class
# model: model type for the class. Currently supported models are "cuboid" and "cylinder". For ground class, leave the value empty.

# For cuboid model, the following fields are required:
# track_assignment_threshold: threshold for assigning and merging two cuboid tracks, during Hungarian Assignment, as one, based on their centroid distance.
# length_cutoff: minimum and maximum length of the cuboid
# width_cutoff: minimum and maximum width of the cuboid
# height_cutoff: minimum and maximum height of the cuboid

# TODO(ankit): Add instructions for cylinder model

# All ground planes must be named as "ground" in the class_info.yaml file.
# This "ground" string is used to determine if a ground plane can be extracted from segmented point cloud.
